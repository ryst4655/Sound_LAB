Sampling - Hammond organ M3
Similar to last week, this was a matter of detail when it came to sampling and audacity as a whole.
In the beggining, I found it hard to use some of the samples from a round robin format that we have used in the past.
While even many of my Ableton skills still lack in some of the simple aspects, that tend to lead to more time needed to spend on tasks like these to make sure I can get to the desired place that I need.
Going through and making this midi was more of an expression of the chords themselves then the composition as a whole. 
While hopefully in the future, tackling these small things, the ease of the smaller things will help when producing and trying to form something that sounds auditory pleasing.
As for Ableton, I feel like I went overload on the vibrato all across the board but I like messing with the lines and world of too much saturation sometimes and see how far I can go.\
